## hugo to gh-pages

Combines a pre-built image with hugo and other required tools with a script to publish back to gh-pages branch.

Inspired by https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo, but I wanted a faster deploy (pre-built image) and to combine the gh-pages deployment.

## Getting started

```yaml
name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
      with:
        submodules: true
    - name: build
      uses: mattbailey/actions-hugo@v0.105.0
      if: github.event.deleted == false
      with:
        args: --gc --minify
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MY_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
```

## On Tokens

GitHub doesn't recognize this as a bug, but if you use `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (which is a token generated by Actions), site publishing will _not_ work in some scenarios, and it will _not_ tell you why. You'll just get a "Page build failed" in your repo's settings tab, with no further information. As above, add your _own_ personal access token with write access to your repo to GitHub Secrets for your repository and reference it in your action.

I opened a support ticket about this, the response was:

> ... GitHub Pages site builds arenâ€™t able to be triggered by bot users or integrations that push to your repository. This is to prevent excessive resource usage and abuse of GitHub Pages systems.
> You can work around this but it will require your integration to push your code back to GitHub using a Personal Access Token created by your account.
